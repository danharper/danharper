### Hi there 👋

* 💻 I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [Meta](https://meta.com), where I work across our "Work" products such as [Horizon Workrooms](https://workrooms.com) and [Workplace](https://workplace.com).  
* ⌨️ Prior to that, I led a small engineering team at [Radweb](https://radweb.co.uk), working on [InventoryBase](https://inventorybase.com) among other things.  
* 🐣 And prior to that, I cut my teeth running a popular Halo 2 modding community, which led me to web development.
* :octocat: I was on the core [Babel](https://babeljs.io) team for a short amount of time before joining Facebook.
  * 🛠 Improved parsing [[1]](https://github.com/babel/babel/commits?author=danharper)[[2]](https://github.com/babel/babylon/commits?author=danharper) of Flow types, enabling a richer [set of ESLint plugins for Flow syntax](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype/commits?author=danharper).
* :brain: My experience is mostly in PHP & JavaScript (React, TypeScript, Flow, Laravel), and software architecture. More recently I've been working in C++ and Objective C for native Windows & Mac development of the [Messenger Desktop](https://www.messenger.com/desktop) app.

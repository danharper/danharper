### Hi there üëã

* üíª I'm a Software Engineer at [Facebook](https://facebook.com), where I work on [Messenger](https://messenger.com) and [Workplace](https://workplace.com).  
* ‚å®Ô∏è Prior to that, I led a small engineering team at [Radweb](https://radweb.co.uk), working on [InventoryBase](https://inventorybase.com) among other things.  
* üê£ And prior to that, I cut my teeth running a popular Halo 2 modding community, which led me to web development.

I was on the core [Babel](https://babeljs.io) team for a short amount of time before joining Facebook. I mostly improved [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/commits?author=danharper)/[Babylon](https://github.com/babel/babylon/commits?author=danharper)'s parsing of Flow types, enabling a richer [set of ESLint plugins to be created for Flow syntax](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype/commits?author=danharper).

My GitHub is mainly random side projects/explorations. My experience is mostly in PHP, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Flow, React Native, Laravel, and Node. I've been dabbling in some C++ and Objective C for native Windows & Mac development.
